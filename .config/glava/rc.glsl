/* PulseAudio sample buffer size. Lower values result in more

   will also require all transformations to be applied much
   more frequently (CPU intensive).

   High (>2048, with 22050 Hz) values will decrease accuracy
   (as some signals can be missed by transformations like FFT)

   The following settings (@22050 Hz) produce the listed rates:

   Sample    UPS                  Description
   - 2048 -> 43.0  (low accuracy, cheap), use with < 60 FPS
   - 1024 -> 86.1  (high accuracy, expensive), use with >= 60 FPS
   -  512 -> 172.3 (extreme accuracy, very expensive), use only
                   for graphing accurate spectrum data with
                   custom modules.

   If the framerate drops below the update rate, the update rate
   will be locked to the framerate (to prevent wasting CPU time).
   This behaviour means you can use a 1024 sample size on a 60Hz
   monitor with vsync enabled to get 60FPS and 60UPS.

   For high refresh rate monitors (120+ Hz), it's recommended to
   also stick with the 1024 sample size and use interpolation to
   smooth the data, as accuracy beyond this setting is mostly
   meaningless for visual purposes.
