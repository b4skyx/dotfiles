## Installation

I suggest you to go through configs and cherrypick what you need. Might be time consuming, but will provide you a setup you're happy with.

Though if you simply wish to clone my setup on your machine, first step is to install the applications I use on your distro. The major ones are listed above.

Then run the following in your terminal

```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b4skyx/dotfiles/master/install.sh)
```

This will _backup your existing configs_ and setup mine.<br>
